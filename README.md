From current maintainer Lumine1909: I'm considering drop support of 1.20.5- servers, so I add bstats to collect user's version info. If there aren't enough users in those legacy versions, I'll do that in roughly next minor version. Then I will rewrite the plugin to improve its performance and readability, just like what I did [here](https://github.com/Lumine1909/CustomBiomeColors_Continue).

# Panilla
Panilla (the name) is a combination of the word Packet and Vanilla (as in Vanilla Minecraft).

If you would like support for a server platform or Minecraft version that is not listed, please make an issue on GitHub.  

## Compiling
In order for you to compile Panilla, you will need to use [BuildTools, by SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools), and build each version of CraftBukkit which is supported by Panilla.
When you run BuildTools, it will add the dependencies required (CraftBukkit/Bukkit) to your local Maven repository.
From there, you can compile the project with `./gradlew build`. The output plugin jars file will located in the `target/` directory.

Java 21 is required to build Panilla.
